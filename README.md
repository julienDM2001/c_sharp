Loading Data from CSV:
The application starts by loading sales data from a CSV file named supermarket.csv using the LoadCsvData method. This method reads the file, extracts the headers to create the columns of a DataTable, and then fills the table with the rows of data.

Basic Data Analysis:
Once the data is loaded into the DataTable, the AnalyzeData method performs several basic analyses:

Total Sales: Displays the number of sales records (rows) in the CSV.
Total Revenue: Sums up the 'Total' column values to determine the total revenue.
Average Rating per Product Line: For each unique product line, it calculates and displays the average rating.
Sales Trend Over Time:
The SalesTrendOverTime method groups sales data by date and then sums the sales for each date. It then displays these sales figures in the console. With the ScottPlot integration, it also visualizes this sales trend as a line chart, providing a graphical representation of how sales have progressed over time.

Most Popular Product Line:
The MostPopularProductLine method determines which product line has the most sales. It counts the occurrences of each product line in the dataset and identifies the most popular one.

Data Parsing:
Given the potential for data inconsistencies in the CSV, the code employs defensive programming techniques like TryParse to safely handle data parsing. It ensures that even if there are unexpected data formats, the program will not crash.

Data Visualization (using ScottPlot):
With the addition of ScottPlot, the project can visualize sales trends over time using a line chart. This visualization provides a more intuitive way to understand the data compared to just looking at numbers.

In summary, this practice project offers hands-on experience in data parsing, data analysis, and data visualization in C#. It mimics real-world scenarios where developers need to extract insights from data sets and present them in an understandable manner. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to delve deeper into data analysis or data visualization using C#.
